# üåç **Seismic-XR: Simulating and Visualizing Seismic Ground Motions in Mixed Reality** 
> ‚ÄúIn this project, we developed an interactive mixed reality experience to visualize seismic wave ground motion and its velocity model of Himalayan Region. This immersive approach enhances understanding and provides a comprehensive perspective on the impact of seismic activity over large areas, aiding in both research and education, using SPECFEM3D, Unity, and QGIS.‚Äù
